# FINAL-PROJECT
With my Final project at PLP I decided to create a Website.
I chose this because I felt intrigued by the Web Dev Module and hence to put what I learnt to the test.
It wasn't easy but with more practice and research I was able to feel comfortable with writing html, css and js codes.
What I like about this website is that I can use it as a base of my future projects.
